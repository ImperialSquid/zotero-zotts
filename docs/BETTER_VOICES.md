If you're looking to improve the voices you currently have, hopefully this guide can help!

# Windows
[This guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/topic/download-languages-and-voices-for-immersive-reader-read-mode-and-read-aloud-4c83a8d8-7486-42f7-8e46-2b0fdf753130) from Microsoft contains lot of info like:
- where to find the voices currently installed
- how to install more voices from Microsoft
- third party vendors where you can purchase voices
- open source projects with free voices

# MacOS
As helpfully pointed out by user `jeofo` in [this issue](https://github.com/ImperialSquid/zotero-zotts/issues/151), Mac users can access enhanced and premium versions of many of the voices available. See [this guide](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mchlp2290/mac) for installing more voices on Mac.

# Linux
On Linux machines, ZoTTS relies on [`speech dispatcher`](https://github.com/brailcom/speechd) to run TTS so familiarising yourself with that will help.

You can find their complete documentation [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brailcom/speechd/blob/master/doc/speech-dispatcher.html). Documentation about supported modules is [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brailcom/speechd/blob/master/doc/speech-dispatcher.html#Synthesis-Output-Modules) and how to configure them is [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/brailcom/speechd/blob/master/doc/speech-dispatcher.html#Output-Modules-Configuration).

Speech dispatcher is fairly complex, so I'd recommend taking your time and asking them if you run into trouble (I would help if I could but I'm not a linux native and the original devs will be much better placed to assist you!)
